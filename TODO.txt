- Simultaneously have n networks learning and periodically replace the worst by fresh random networks
- Neuron statistics: which neurons are irrelevant? How many?
- Recombine the best neurons of two networks -> periodically keep 33% best, 33% recombined from the best, 33% fresh
- Devise measure how important an hidden neuron is - whether it influences stuff into correct or incorrect direction. Is
  this the same thing as the weight of its output?
- Extend input by fibonacci sequence

- Debug competition. Evtl. learn -> Optional[COMPETITOR] zum ignorieren von Fehlern.
